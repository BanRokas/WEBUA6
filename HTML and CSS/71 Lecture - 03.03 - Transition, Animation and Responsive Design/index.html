    <section> <!-- Transform -->
      <h2>Transform</h2>
      <p>
        Transform - style that allows us to change the appearance of the elements in ways described below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>rotate(Z) - rotates element around it's Z axis</li>
        <li>rotateX(X) - rotates element around it's X axis</li>
        <li>rotateY(Y) - rotates element around it's Y axis</li>
        <li>rotateZ(Z) - rotates element around it's Z axis</li>
        <li>translate(X, Y) - moves the element in X and Y axis</li>
        <li>translateX(X) - moves the element in X axis</li>
        <li>translateY(Y) - moves the element in Y axis</li>
        <li>scale(X, Y) - scales the element's X and Y size with all of it's content</li>
        <li>scaleX(X) - scales the element's X size with all of it's content</li>
        <li>scaleY(Y) - scales the element's Y size with all of it's content</li>
        <li>skew(X, Y) - stretches the element from the opposite corners</li>
        <li>skewX(X) - stretches the element from the opposite corners</li>
        <li>skewY(Y) - stretches the element from the opposite corners</li>
        <li>matrix()</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="transformTestContainer">
        <div class="rotate">Rotate</div>
        <div class="translate">Translate</div>
        <div class="scale">Scale</div>
        <div class="skew">Skew</div>
        <div class="skewX">SkewX</div>
        <div class="skewY">SkewY</div>
        <div class="combination">Combination</div>
      </div>
      <h3>Transform Origin</h3>
      <p>
        transform-origin style tells the element from which position it's transformation should begin.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <!-- Transition -->
      <h2>Transition</h2>
      <p>
        Transition is controlling how element goes from one state to another.<br>
        Most commonly transitions are being used together with :hover pseudo-class.<br>
        Transition only happens once per action. From default to changed and back after you remove the cursors or whatever triggered the transition.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>transition-duration: seconds - how long does transition takes</li>
        <li>transition-delay: seconds - after how much time transition begins</li>
        <li>transition-timing-function: function - how the time is used to display the whole transition</li>
        <li>transition-style: CSSstyle - for which style transition options are assigned</li>
        <li>transition-behavior: normal | allow-discrete - ???</li>
        <li>transition: duration delay ...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not all styles can have a transition.
      </p>
      <div class="transition">Transition</div>
    </section>
    <section> <!-- animation -->
      <h2>Animation</h2>
      <p>
        Animation is controlling how element changes in between many states.<br>
        For animation to start, there is no need for user interaction, tho there can be user interaction. Animation can repeat as many times as we want.<br>
        During the animation, same styles can change many times in between different states.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>animation-duration: seconds - how long does cycle of animation takes</li>
        <li>animation-delay: seconds - after what delay cycle of animation restars</li>
        <li>animation-timing-function: function - how the time is used to display the whole animation cycle</li>
        <li>animation-name: randomName - we think of name to give an animation</li>
        <li>animation-iteration-count: number | infinite - how many cycles of animations has to run before it stops</li>
        <li>animation-direction: normal | reverse | alternate | alternate-reverse - from which end animation starts and does it alternate</li>
        <li>animation-play-state: running | paused;</li>
        <li>animation-fill-mode: none | forwards | backwards | both - tells how element is displayed before and/or after the animation</li>
        <li>animation-composition: replace | add | accumulate - how different tranform values work in between different frames</li>
        <li>animation: duration delay ...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So, for the animation settings to do something, we need to set up the animation keyframes as well.<br>
        (exhample: @keyframes randomName { 0%{} 50%{} 100%{} })
      </p>
