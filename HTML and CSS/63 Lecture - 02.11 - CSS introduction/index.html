      <h2>Ways to write CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Inline - write CSS in tag's style attribute</li>
        <li>Internal - to write CSS in HTML file, in style tag (which is normally placed in a head)</li>
        <li>External - to write CSS in a separate file and link it to the HTML</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h3>Inline</h3>
          <p>
            <span>Inline CSS</span> is normally used to test out styles or to inject a specific style onto HTML element from JavaScript.<br>
            In order to use inline style, we need to add attribute called "style" to the tag and write CSS code as it's value.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Internal</h3>
          <p>
            <span>Internal CSS</span> is normally used to test out styles or/and selectors inside of an HTML element without the need of creating additional CSS file.<br>
            In order to use internal style, we need to create "style" tag (normally inside of a head tag) and write CSS code in there.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>External</h3>
          <p>
            <span>External CSS</span> is used most commonly (practically always).<br>
            In order to use external style, we need to create additional file of CSS type and link it to the HTML file inside of which we want the styles of CSS file to work.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <section> <!-- Selectors -->
      <h2 id="do-not-use-id-in-css">Selectors</h2>
      <p class="our-css-class">
        Selectors are part of CSS code which selects which HTML elements should have the styles that are written inside of those selectors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>tag - selects all the tags which names match the one in CSS code</li>
        <li>multiple - using comma, we can write multiple selectors and give them all same styles</li>
        <li>* - all selector</li>
        <li>.class - make up some kind of name</li>
        <li>#id - make up some kind of name</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h3>Class</h3>
          <p>
            To create a class in CSS file, we need to write "." and after it without any spaces we need to write the name of the class (name should be logical, short and describe what class is used for): ".nameOfTheClass".<br>
            To give HTML element any class, we need to give HTML element attribute of "class" and value of "nameOfTheClass".<br>
            We can give as many classes to a single element as we want AND we can use same class on multiple elements. (many-to-many relation)
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Id</h3>
          <p>
            To create an ID in CSS file, we need to write "#" and after it without any spaces we need to write the name of the ID (name should be logical, short and describe what ID is used for): "#nameOfTheID".<br>
            To give HTML element any ID, we need to give HTML element attribute of "id" and value of "nameOfTheID".<br>
            We can give a single id to a single element AND we can use a single id only once. (one-to-one relation)
